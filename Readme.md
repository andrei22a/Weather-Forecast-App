# Weather Forecast App - Andrei Alexa

In this project we create a GUI application to show te 5-day weather forecast for a specified city using 
data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

The application will have a search bar in which the user enters the city name for which he wants to see 
the forecast.

In order to make it more challenging, we are searching the data by latitude and longitude, not by city 
name, therefore we need to map city names to coordinates. We'll do that using the GeoPy library.
